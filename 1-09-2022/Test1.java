In KMIT institution there is a special keyboard designed by a student.
It contains only one row of 26-keys, keys[], each key indicates a unique letter 
in the alphabet from 'a' to 'z' in the given order.

The order of keys in that keyboard will be given.
You need to findout the time taken to type a word.

The rules to calculate the time is as follows:
* Initially you will be at the first key .i.e, keys[0].
* To type a letter, you have to move to the key having desired letter, key[j].
* Time taken to type the character from key at i-th index to key at j-th index 
  is |i - j|.

NOTE: You need to press only one key at a time to type the word.

INPUT FORMAT:
-------------
Line-1: A string S, consists of order of the keys in the keyboard.
Line-2: A string W, the word to be typed.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
--------------
Print an integer result, the time taken to type the word.


SAMPLE INPUT-1:
---------------
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

SAMPLE OUTPUT-1:
----------------
code

EXPLANATION:
------------
Given word is "code"
- Time taken to type letter-c: from keys[0] to keys[2] => | 0 - 2 | = 2
- Time taken to type letter-o: from keys[2] to keys[14] => | 2 - 14 | = 12
- Time taken to type letter-d: from keys[14] to keys[3] => | 14 - 3 | = 11
- Time taken to type letter-e: from keys[3] to keys[4] => | 3 - 4 | = 1
Total time taken is : 26


SAMPLE INPUT-2:
---------------
poiuytrewqasdfghjklmnbvcxz
kmit

SAMPLE OUTPUT-2:
----------------
39

EXPLANATION:
------------
Given word is "kmit"
- Time taken to type letter-k: from keys[0] to keys[17] => | 0 - 17 | = 17
- Time taken to type letter-m: from keys[17] to keys[19] => | 17 - 19 | = 2
- Time taken to type letter-i: from keys[19] to keys[2] => | 20 - 2 | = 17
- Time taken to type letter-t: from keys[2] to keys[5] => | 2 - 5 | = 3
Total time taken is : 39
